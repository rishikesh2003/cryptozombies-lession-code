# CryptoZombies 🧟‍♂️  

This repository contains the code for the **CryptoZombies** learning platform, where users can master **Ethereum smart contract development** through fun, interactive lessons. Each lesson teaches essential blockchain development concepts with practical examples.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

The project is structured for easy navigation:  
- **Lessons as files**: If a lesson contains only one file, it is named after the lesson (e.g., `lesson-1.sol`).  
- **Lessons as folders**: If a lesson involves multiple files, it is stored in a folder named after the lesson (e.g., `lesson-2/`).
